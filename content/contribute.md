If you just want to tell us about one tiny thing and you don’t have bandwidth for a tutorial right now, feel free to email a short description of the change you want to propose to  info@secfirst.org or [open an issue](https://github.com/securityfirst/tent-content/issues/new) in our [Tent content repo](https://github.com/securityfirst/tent-content).

#### Using GitHub and Prose.io 

If you are not familiar with git, GitHub and Markdown, read our [beginner tutorial for editing content hosted in a GitHub repo using prose.io](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y9TMmvkOh_DiVm6Qdw9imEHomGabcbHxJhHFVRtcXeQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Report bugs

Unfortunately stuff breaks sometimes. 
If you are in a hurry and have found a code or content problem then please email it to <support@secfirst.org>. 
If you have a little more time we generally try to manage any bugs using GitHub. 
If something is broken, please let us know so we can fix it! 
Creating an issue on our [Umbrella Android](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_android/issues), [Umbrella iOS](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_iOS/issues) or [Umbrella web](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_web/issues) issue trackers.

If the issue you have identified is a security risk to users, please
[read the Responsible Disclosure and Bug Bounty section below](#responsible-disclosure-and-bug-bounty).

If you wish to contact us via PGP, please drop a mail to
<rory@secfirst.org> ([2C1D3B4D](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xFFB9B5BE2C1D3B4D))

After reporting a bug on GitHub, if the Umbrella developers make a code change that resolves your issue, then your GitHub issue will typically be closed from the relevant patch message. 
If, after testing the fix, you find that it does not really fix your bug, please leave a comment on your issue explaining the situation. 
When you do, we will receive a notification and respond on your issue or reopen it (or both). 
Please do not create a duplicate issue.

In other cases, your issue may be closed with a specific resolution, such as `R: duplicate`, or `R: wontfix`. 
Each of these labels has a description that explains the label. 
We’ll also leave a comment explaining why we’re closing the issue with one of these specific resolutions. 
If the issue is closed without one of these specific resolutions, then it means, by default, that your reported bug was fixed or your requested enhancement was implemented

## Responsible Disclosure and Bug Bounty

If you find a security critical issue, please read our [responsible disclosure policy](https://secfirst.org/legal.html).

Security First participates in the HackerOne bug bounty system, an information security best practice. In return, you get free swag and recognition. Visit our page and read the rules [here](https://hackerone.com/security_first). (Sign up for an account if you don’t have one.)

## Contribute Ideas

Ideas are powerful things! 
If you have any about what we could do better or things which you think we should do in future, please email us at info@secfirst.org. 
Alternatively, you may open a feature request as a GitHub issue. 

## Contribute Code 

Wanna write code people rely on daily to make life or death decisions? We would love your help, especially in the following areas:

- Android (Java/Kotlin) development
- iOS development
- Web app development
- Golang development
- React development
- Gamification
- UI/UX

Our code for [Umbrella Android](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_android), [Umbrella iOS](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_ios) and [Umbrella Web](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_web) on GitHub.

We have a really big development plan of functionality we want to include in the future and are currently in the process of building a way to manage contributions from the open source community. 
Until we have that up, please drop us a mail to <info@secfirst.org> if you are interested in a contributing a specific part of future code.

If there is something you want to help out with in the interim, then here is some basic advice:

1.  Fork the repo!

2.  Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`

3.  Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`

4.  Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`

5.  Submit a pull request :D


Most often, you have to test your changes to ensure that they work as expected before submitting them to us. See our [build instructions for Umbrella Android](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_android/blob/master/BUILD.md) and [Umbrella Web](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_web/blob/master/BUILD.md). 


## Improve documentation

Umbrella's documentation, especially the [user manual](https://secfirst.org/umbrella/manual), would greatly benefit from your help. 
Good documentation is difficult to keep up-to-date. 
You can help us edit or write new content for the unser manual. 
In addition, if you find a typo or an error on any page of the [secfirst.org](https://secfirst.org/umbrella/) website please let us know — ideally, by submitting a pull request against the [secfirst repo](https://github.com/securityfirst/secfirst.org) with your correction.

If you have a question about something you read in the documentation, please send us a mail to <info@secfirst.org>.

Here are a few guidelines and Markdown conventions to keep in mind when writing documentation for Umbrella. Doing so helps creating a consistent language across the documentation:

- Do not duplicate documentation. Duplicating documentation is almost always a bad idea, since it presents a maintainance issue. Almost all documentation has to be updated as some point, and when similar documentation appears in more than one place, it is very easy for it to get updated in one place but not the others When this happens, this leads to inconsitent, and the outdated documentation becomes a trap, especially for novice users. The solution is to link to existing documentation rather than duplicating it. There are some exceptions to this policy (e.g., information that is certain not to change for a very long time), but they are rare.
- In order to enable offline browsing, always use relative (rather than absolute) links, e.g., /umbrella/manual/ instead of https://www.securityfirst.org/umbrella/manual/. An exception to this rule is when linking to files like README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md

## Translate

You can help correct, improve, or complete the translations of Umbrella content into your native language. Umbrella is being translated into more than a dozen languages, and you can help.
Most of Umbrella can be translated directly online, through a simple web interface, after logging in with [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/otf/umbrella-app/). 
Umbrella can be translated into more than 140 languages this way.

To get started:

- Create a free account with [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/).
- Click [Help Translate Umbrella App](https://www.transifex.com/otf/umbrella-app/).
- Choose your language and translate something. Even a single sentence helps!

The awesome [Localization Lab](http://www.localizationlab.org/) manage volunteer translators for Umbrella (read their guide [here](https://www.localizationlab.org/guide)). If you are an organisation, the fastest way to see Umbrella in your language is to [donate](#funding) money for us to hire a translator. Thank you!
